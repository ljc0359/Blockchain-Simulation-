# Blockchain-Simulation-
This is a p2p blockchain simulation created by Jiacheng Li and Kefan Liu

# Before you start

1. Install the `crytography` package by running the command `pip (or pip3) install cryptography`.
2. Create a new file `nodes.txt` in the same directory as the program. Set up the nodes you want to connect with in the text file `nodes.txt`.
3. Change `run.bat` (or `run.sh`) according to how many nodes you want to run, and the port numbers of each of them.
4. Change `kill_nodes.bat` (or `kill_nodes.sh`) according to the same node setup as above.

# Getting started

Just run `bash run.sh` (on Unix) or `run.bat` (on Windows) to start the simulation on the local machine. If you need to stop their services, just run `kill_nodes.sh` (on Unix) or `kill_nodes.bat` (on Windows). Have fun!
